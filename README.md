A drum machine paired with a 16 step sequencer enables you to write fresh beats in your browser. You can play the drum machine with your keyboard by using the keys labeled on the drum pads. Recording sequences is easy. If the record button is activated, any notes that are played will be recorded to the current step. Pressing play starts the playing the sequence and pressing stop ends playback.
